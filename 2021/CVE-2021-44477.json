To reduce the risk vulnerabilities such as these may represent to the controls network, GE recommends the implementation of a good defense-in-depth strategy as detailed in GEH-6839. Some recommended controls include:\n    Minimize network exposure for all controllers with the use of network segmentation, placement of controllers behind controls network firewalls and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\n    Block suspicious external IP addresses at the controls network firewalls. Monitor traffic internally for unusual behavior.\n    When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n    Implement defense-in-depth within the controls network environment consisting of tools such as Intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), firewalls, and network access control (NAC).\n    Implement and maintain an anti-malware solution and an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution.\n    Disable remote access services and protocols such as remote desktop protocol (RDP) unless needed. Monitor and restrict remote access usage on a least-privilege basis.\n    Have backup and restore processes and procedures in place for disaster recovery and incident response.\n    Monitor and maintain account provisioning and access control based on the principle of least privilege."
