An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by looking at the raw HTTP requests that are sent to the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain some of the passwords that are configured throughout the interface.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
