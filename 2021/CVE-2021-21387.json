In wrongthink from version 2.0.0 and before 2.3.0 there was a set of vulnerabilities causing inadequate encryption strength. Part of the secret identity key was disclosed by the fingerprint used for connection. Additionally, the safety number was improperly calculated. It was computed using part of one of the public identity keys instead of being derived from both public identity keys. This caused issues in computing safety numbers which would potentially be exploitable in the real world. Additionally there was inadequate encryption strength due to use of 1024-bit DSA keys. These issues are all fixed in version 2.3.0."
