The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device as a high-privileged user, adding certain configurations with malicious code in one of its fields, and persuading another user to click on it. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or to access sensitive, browser-based information."
