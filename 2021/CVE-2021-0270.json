As this is a race condition situation this issue become more likely to be hit when network instability occurs, such as but not limited to BGP/IGP reconvergences, and/or further likely to occur when more active \"traffic flows\" are occurring through the device. When this issue occurs, it will cause one or more FPCs to restart unexpectedly. During FPC restarts core files will be generated. While the core file is generated traffic will be disrupted. Sustained receipt of large traffic flows and reconvergence-like situations may sustain the Denial of Service (DoS) situation.
