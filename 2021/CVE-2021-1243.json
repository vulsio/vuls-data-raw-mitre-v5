This vulnerability is due to incorrect LPTS programming when using SNMP with management plane protection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an affected device using SNMP. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to connect to the device on the configured SNMP ports. Valid credentials are required to execute any of the SNMP requests."
