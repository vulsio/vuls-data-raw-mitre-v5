Refer to the Philips \nPatient Monitoring System Security for Clinical Networks guide for \nadditional information on  InCenter https://incenter.medical.philips.com/ .\n\n  *  By default, the simple certificate enrollment protocol (SCEP) \nservice is not running. When needed, the service is configured to run \nbased on the duration or the number of certificates to be assigned. One \ncertificate is default, but if a certificate is not issued, the service \nwill continue to run. Limit exposure by ensuring the SCEP service is not\n running unless it is actively being used to enroll new devices.\n\n  *  When enrolling new devices using SCEP, enter a unique challenge password of 8-12 unpredictable and randomized digits.\n\n  *  Implement physical security controls to prevent unauthorized login \nattempts on the PIC iX application. Servers should be kept in controlled\n locked data centers. Access to equipment at nurses’ stations should be \ncontrolled and monitored.\n\n  *  Only grant remote access to PIC iX servers on a must-have basis.\n\n  *  Grant login privileges to the bedside monitor and PIC iX application\n on a role-based, least-privilege basis, and only to trusted users.\n\n\n\n\nUsers with questions regarding their specific Philips Patient \nInformation Center (PIC iX) and/or IntelliVue patient monitor \ninstallations and new release eligibility should contact their local  Philips service support team, or regional service support https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/solutions/customer-service-solutions , or call 1-800-722-9377.\n\n\nPlease see the  Philips product security website https://www.philips.com/productsecurity  for the Philips advisory and the latest security information for Philips products.\n\n\n\n\n",
