Supported versions that are affected are 8.1.0, 8.2.0 and 8.3.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Enterprise Session Border Controller. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Enterprise Session Border Controller, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle Enterprise Session Border Controller as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Enterprise Session Border Controller accessible data and unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Enterprise Session Border Controller accessible data.
