The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious data to a specific field within the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
