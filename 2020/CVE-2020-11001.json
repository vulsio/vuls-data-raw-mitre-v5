A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail\nadmin could potentially craft a page revision history that, when viewed by a user with higher privileges, could perform\nactions with that user's credentials. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to\nthe Wagtail admin.\n\nPatched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.7.2 (for the LTS 2.7 branch) and Wagtail 2.8.1 (for the current 2.8 branch)."
