An attacker can provide a specially crafted shader file to trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability potentially could be triggered from guest machines running virtualization environments (ie. VMware, qemu, VirtualBox etc.) in order to perform guest-to-host escape - as it was demonstrated before (TALOS-2018-0533, TALOS-2018-0568, etc.). Theoretically this vulnerability could be also triggered from web browser (using webGL and webassembly). This vulnerability was triggered from HYPER-V guest using RemoteFX feature leading to executing the vulnerable code on the HYPER-V host (inside of the rdvgm.exe process)."
