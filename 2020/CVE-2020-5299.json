This requires attackers to achieve the following before a successful attack can be completed: 1. Have found a vulnerability in the victims spreadsheet software of choice. 2. Control data that would potentially be exported through the `ImportExportController` by a theoretical victim. 3. Convince the victim to export above data as a CSV and run it in vulnerable spreadsheet software while also bypassing any sanity checks by said software. Issue has been patched in Build 466 (v1.0.466)."
