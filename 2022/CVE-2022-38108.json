					"value": "SolarWinds recommends customers upgrade to SolarWinds Platform version 2022.4 as soon as it becomes available. The expected RC release is at the end of October. SolarWinds also recommends that customers follow the guidance provided in the SolarWinds Secure Configuration Guide (https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/orionplatform/content/core-secure-configuration.htm). Ensure only authorized users can access the SolarWinds Platform. Special attention should be given to the following points from documentation:  \n•\tBe careful not to expose your SolarWinds Platform website on the public Internet. If you must enable outbound Internet access from SolarWinds Servers, create a strict allow list and block all other traffic. See SolarWinds Platform Product Features Affected by Internet Access (https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Orion-Platform-Product-Features-Affected-by-Internet-Access). \n•\tDisable unnecessary ports, protocols, and services on your host operating system and on applications, like SQL Server. For more details, see the SolarWinds Port Requirements guide (https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/orionplatform/content/core-solarwinds-port-requirements.htm) and Best practices for configuring Windows Defender Firewall (© 2021 Microsoft, available at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/best-practices-configuring, obtained on January 13, 2021.) \n•\tApply proper segmentation controls on the network where you have deployed the SolarWinds Platform and SQL Server instances. \n•\tConfigure the firewall for the main polling engine to limit and restrict all inbound and outbound access for port 5671. Port 5671 should only communicate to your other SolarWinds Servers (in case of High Availability, both Active and Standby Primary Polling Engine Servers). You can check these by querying the OrionServers table in the SolarWinds Platform database. Ensure this rule is updated when the configuration of SolarWinds Platform changes, for example when you add new servers. \n"
