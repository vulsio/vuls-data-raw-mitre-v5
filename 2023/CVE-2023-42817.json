					"value": "Pimcore admin-ui-classic-bundle provides a Backend UI for Pimcore. The translation value with text including “%s” (from “%suggest%) is parsed by sprintf() even though it’s supposed to be output literally to the user. The translations may be accessible by a user with comparatively lower overall access (as the translation permission cannot be scoped to certain “modules”) and a skilled attacker might be able to exploit the parsing of the translation string in the dialog box. This issue has been patched in commit `abd77392` which is included in release 1.1.2. Users are advised to update to version 1.1.2 or apply the patch manually.\n"
