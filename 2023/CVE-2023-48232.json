				{
					"lang": "en",
					"value": "Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception may occur when calculating the line offset for overlong lines and smooth scrolling is enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag. This may happen when a window border is present and when the wrapped line continues on the next physical line directly in the window border because the 'cpo' setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-default settings are affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been addressed in commit `cb0b99f0` which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
