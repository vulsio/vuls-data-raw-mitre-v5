This results in reflected data and injection of malicious code into a downloaded executable. The executable can be used to execute malicious queries or as a denial-of-service vector. NOTE: this CVE Record is only about the parameters, such as the h parameter (this CVE Record is not about the separate issue of signed executable files that are supposed to have unique configurations across customers' installations)."
