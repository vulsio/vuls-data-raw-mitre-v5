This can lead to an authentication system failure and compromise system security. Versions of cloudexplorer-lite prior to 1.2.0 did not enforce strong passwords. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.2.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
