This would impact the available and shown information in certain places, such as the user search and avatar menu. If a manipulated user modifies their own data in the personal settings the entry is fixed again.\n\nNextcloud Server n 25.0.7 and 26.0.2 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server 21.0.9.12, 22.2.10.12, 23.0.12.7, 24.0.12.2, 25.0.7, and 26.0.2 contain a patch for this issue. A workaround is available. Remove all trusted servers in the \"Administration\" > \"Sharing\" settings `â€¦/index.php/settings/admin/sharing`. Afterwards, trigger a recreation of the local system addressbook with the following `occ dav:sync-system-addressbook`."
