					"lang": "en",
					"value": "A vulnerability in the GRand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) for Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to the device to view sensitive files on the console using the GRUB bootloader command line. This vulnerability is due to the inclusion of unnecessary commands within the GRUB environment that allow sensitive files to be viewed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by being connected to the console port of the Cisco IOS XR device when the device is power-cycled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive files that could be used to conduct additional attacks against the device."
