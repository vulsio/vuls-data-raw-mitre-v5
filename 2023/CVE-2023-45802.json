On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.\n\nThis was found by the reporter during testing ofÂ CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During \"normal\" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.",
