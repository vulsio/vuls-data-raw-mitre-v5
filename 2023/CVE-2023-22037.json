Supported versions that are affected are 12.2.3-12.2.12. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Web Applications Desktop Integrator.  Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Web Applications Desktop Integrator, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Web Applications Desktop Integrator accessible data as well as  unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Web Applications Desktop Integrator accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Web Applications Desktop Integrator. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 6.5 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts).  CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)."
