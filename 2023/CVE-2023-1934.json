By implementing proper network segmentation and isolating the SCADA system from public networks, users can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and exploitation.\n  *  Implement strong access controls: Ensure that proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to limit access to sensitive components of the SCADA system. This includes implementing role-based access control and regular audits of user privileges.\n  *  Monitor and log activity: Continuously monitor and log all activities within the SCADA environment. This helps with detecting any potential unauthorized access or attempts to exploit the vulnerability, enabling timely response and mitigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
