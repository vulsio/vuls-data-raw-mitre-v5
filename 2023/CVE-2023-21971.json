Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Connectors.  Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Connectors as well as  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of MySQL Connectors accessible data and  unauthorized read access to a subset of MySQL Connectors accessible data.
