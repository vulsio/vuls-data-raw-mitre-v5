Due to this bug,\nthe local variable that means \"let the host resolve the name\" could get the\nwrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention,\ncopy the too long host name to the target buffer instead of copying just the\nresolved address there.\n\nThe target buffer being a heap based buffer, and the host name coming from the\nURL that curl has been told to operate with.\n"
