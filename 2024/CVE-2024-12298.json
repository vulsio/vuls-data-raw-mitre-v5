Secure communication is available in the following CPU Units of the stated versions.\n-  NJ series, NX1P2 CPU Unit: Version 1.49 or higher\n\n2.  Anti-virus protection\nProtect any PC with access to the control system against malware and ensure installation and maintenance of up-to-date commercial grade anti-virus software protection.\n\n3.  Security measures to prevent unauthorized access\n-  Minimize connection of control systems and equipment to open networks, so that untrusted devices will be unable to access them.\n-  Implement firewalls (by shutting down unused communications ports, limiting communications hosts) and isolate them from the IT network.\n-  Use a virtual private network (VPN) for remote access to control systems and equipment.\n-  Use strong passwords and change them frequently.\n-  Install physical controls so that only authorized personnel can access control systems and equipment.\n-  Scan virus to ensure safety of any USB drives or similar devices before connecting them to systems and devices.\n-  Enforce multifactor authentication to all devices with remote access to control systems and equipment whenever possible.\n\n4.  Data input and output protection\nValidation processing such as backup and range check to cope with unintentional modification of input/output data to control systems and devices.\n\n5.  Data recovery\nPeriodical data backup and maintenance to prepare for data loss.",
