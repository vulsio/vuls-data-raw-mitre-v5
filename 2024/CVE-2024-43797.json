				{
					"lang": "en",
					"value": "audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. A non-admin user is not allowed to create libraries (or access only the ones they have permission to). However, the `LibraryController` is missing the check for admin user and thus allows a path traversal issue. Allowing non-admin users to write to any directory in the system can be seen as a form of path traversal. However, since it can be restricted to only admin permissions, fixing this is relatively simple and falls more into the realm of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This issue has been addressed in release version 2.13.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
