Elite Key and Custom Key users that have kept their configuration cards secure should continue to be vigilant and restrict access to those cards.\nHID standard key users and other users who are concerned their keys may be compromised should consider steps to update the readers and credentials with new keys. To assist in this effort, HID will be introducing a free upgrade to the Elite Key program. Contact your HID representative for more information.\n\n\nProtect your credentials and disable legacy technologies.\n\n  *  Reading the PACS data from a credential is not enough to clone the credential for modern technologies like Seos and DESFire. These technologies use a credential key for authentication. However, if a system's readers still support legacy technologies (i.e., HID Prox, MiFARE Classic, etc.), then it may be possible to insert the credential information into a legacy technology credential that would be accepted by those readers. Users are encouraged to disable legacy credential technologies in their readers.\nFurther, physical credentials should always be kept safe by their users, and site managers should remind their users to be vigilant with their credentials and report missing or stolen cards.\n\n\nHarden your iCLASS SE Readers from configuration changes\n\n  *  iCLASS SE Readers using firmware firmware version 8.6.04 or higher can use the HID Reader Manager application to prevent the readers from accepting configuration changes from configuration cards. After this is complete, users may then securely destroy their reader configuration cards.\nIf you need assistance, or if the reader firmware has not been updated to 8.6.04 or higher, contact HID Technical Support.\n\n\nHarden your HID OMNIKEY Readers, HID iCLASS SE Reader Modules, HID iCLASS SE Processors from configuration changes\n\n  *  Contact  HID https://www.hidglobal.com/support Â to receive a \"Shield Card\" that will prevent further configuration changes using reader configuration cards.
