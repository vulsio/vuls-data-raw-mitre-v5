					"value": "OAuthenticator provides plugins for JupyterHub to use common OAuth providers, as well as base classes for writing one's own Authenticators with any OAuth 2.0 provider. `GoogleOAuthenticator.hosted_domain` is used to restrict what Google accounts can be authorized access to a JupyterHub. The restriction is intented to be to Google accounts part of one or more Google organization verified to control specified domain(s). Prior to version 16.3.0, the actual restriction has been to Google accounts with emails ending with the domain. Such accounts could have been created by anyone which at one time was able to read an email associated with the domain. This was described by Dylan Ayrey (@dxa4481) in this [blog post] from 15th December 2023). OAuthenticator 16.3.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, restrict who can login another way, such as `allowed_users` or `allowed_google_groups`."
