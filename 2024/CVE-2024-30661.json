This vulnerability could potentially allow a malicious user to gain unauthorized information access to multiple ROS nodes remotely. Unauthorized information access to these nodes could result in compromised system integrity, the execution of arbitrary commands, and disclosure of sensitive information. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability."
