Supported versions that are affected are 8.0.8.1, 8.1.2.7 and  8.1.2.8. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Financial Services Behavior Detection Platform.  Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Financial Services Behavior Detection Platform, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Financial Services Behavior Detection Platform accessible data as well as  unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Financial Services Behavior Detection Platform accessible data.
