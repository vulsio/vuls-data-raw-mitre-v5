Supported versions that are affected are 3.1.6.8003 and earlier, 3.2.1182 and earlier and 3.3.2.1162 and earlier. Easily \"exploitable\" vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Enterprise Monitor. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in MySQL Enterprise Monitor, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all MySQL Enterprise Monitor accessible data as well as unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all MySQL Enterprise Monitor accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of MySQL Enterprise Monitor.
