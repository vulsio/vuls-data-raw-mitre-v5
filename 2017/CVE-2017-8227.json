However, if the same brute force attempt is performed using the ONVIF specification (which is supported by the same binary) then there is no account lockout or timeout executed. This can allow an attacker to circumvent the account protection mechanism and brute force the credentials.

The binary \"sonia\" is the one that has the vulnerable function that performs the credential check in the binary for the ONVIF specification.
