The vulnerability is due to insufficient size validation of user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted H.224 data in Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) packets in an H.323 call. An exploit could allow the attacker to overflow a buffer in a cache that belongs to the received packet parser, which will result in a crash of the application, resulting in a DoS condition. All versions of Cisco Expressway Series Software and Cisco TelePresence VCS Software prior to version X8.8.2 are vulnerable. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCus99263."
